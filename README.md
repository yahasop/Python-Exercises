# Python Exercises

These are some basic Python programs still in progress:

- The API project, made API calls to a webpage called whois that reads IPv4 adresses stored in a txt file line by line, pings them an written some items (fetched from the JSON it generates) into a xlsx workbook.

- The Excel project, reads from a txt file a list of names, generates random countries with a Python library, generates some random numers in a given range and then writes the values into a xlsx workbook.
